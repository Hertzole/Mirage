# Loading scenes in Mirage

Use [NetworkSceneManager](/docs/guides/scene-loading/network-scene-manager) to help load scenes and sync them between server and client.

To customize scene handling you can make a subclass and override the virtual methods.

If you need more unique logic to load scenes you can have full control by following this [guide](/docs/guides/scene-loading/manual-scene-loading).
