# About IDs

## NetId

Mirage uses `uint` for NetId. Every NetworkIdentity is assigned a NetId when it is being spawned. Mirage uses the ID when passing messages between client and server to tell which object is the recipient of the message.

## Prefab Hash

The prefab hash is used to uniquely identify each prefab so that it can be spawned over the network. Mirage will create the prefab hash by taking a 32-bit hash of the Asset path. The path is found using [AssetDatabase.GetAssetPath](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AssetDatabase.GetAssetPath.html)

## Scene ID

Mirage uses `ulong` for Scene IDss. Every game object with a NetworkIdentity in the scene (hierarchy) is assigned a scene ID in OnPostProcessScene. Mirage needs that to distinguish scene objects from each other because Unity has no unique ID for different game objects in the scene.
